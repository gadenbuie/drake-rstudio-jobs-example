```{r, include = FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(
  eval = TRUE,
  collapse = TRUE,
  comment = "##"
)
```

We have a script called `inner.R`.

```r
inside_inner <- 1
```

And another script called `outer.R`.

```r
source("inner.R")
inside_outer <- 2
cat(ls(), sep = "\n", file = "outer.out")

cat(ls(envir = .GlobalEnv), sep = "\n", file = "global.out")
```

Running `outer.R` as an RStudio job:

```{r eval=FALSE}
rstudioapi::jobRunScript("outer.R", workingDir = getwd(), exportEnv = NULL)
```

Yeilding the following results in `outer.out`

```{r}
cat(readLines("outer.out"), sep = "\n")
```

Notice that `inside_inner` is not in the environment where `outer.R` is evaluated, but it is in the global environment.

```{r}
cat(readLines("global.out"), sep = "\n")
```
